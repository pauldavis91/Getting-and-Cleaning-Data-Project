## Script Details
The data was downloaded from the below link, "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones". Unzipped the zip file. Actvity lables and features were loaded in to R. The features which are related to 'mean' and 'standard deviation' were extracted. train and test data sets were loaded in to R and columns which are related to 'mean' and 'standard deviation' are extracted. All the train and test data sets were merged in to single dataset. Colum names were modified to make the dataset tidier. An independent tidy data set was created from this dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
## Dataset  Details 
The tidy data set contains 180 observation of 81 variables.

The 81 variables are listed below. Among which activity and subject are key columns 
* activity - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken, int, 6 possible values:
1. WALKING: subject was walking
2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS: subject was walking upstairs
3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS: subject was walking downstairs
4. SITTING: subject was sitting
5. STANDING: subject was standing
6. LAYING: subject was laying
* subject - The ID of the test subject, int, ranges from 1 to 30.
